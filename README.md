# Flight-Delay-Prediction-Project
The goal of this project is to predict the popularity of online news published by Masheable. We will use Python on a challenging dataset to compute various visualizations to identify what characteristics of online news will lead to a higher number of shares in the social networks. We will also build a machine learning model to predict whether an article is popular or not and display which features are most important for a popular article.
